# Changelog

All notable changes to GitCurator are documented here.
Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/) — `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## [0.0.1] — Initial repository import (V0.01)

First versioned snapshot of GitCurator, published to GitHub as the canonical
online home for all future development. Internal build lineage: the code
below already carries the full v30.x hardening sprint (v30.0 → v30.4).

### Python application (`app/`)
- **Core pipeline** — Telegram Saved Messages → link extraction → GitHub
  repo metadata → local Ollama LLM analysis → structured Obsidian notes,
  with PyQt6 GUI and a headless CLI mode.
- **v30 hardening sprint (all fixes verified by 45 automated tests):**
  - Headless mode can no longer hang (LLM-failure / disk-full / auth-code
    signals all have receivers or non-blocking defaults).
  - `save_config()` rewritten as a merge (unknown keys preserved, atomic
    write) — the "model choice never persisted" bug is fixed end-to-end.
  - All Ollama calls are timeout-wrapped (`llm_timeout_s`, default 300 s).
  - Atomic note/banner writes via tempfile + `os.replace`.
  - URL parsing converged into a single `links.py` module (4 previous
    drifting copies removed).
  - LLM output sanitized before frontmatter (YAML injection neutralized);
    README content treated as untrusted input.
  - Cloudflare stack: HMAC signing fixed (sha256 of shared secret),
    webhook secret-token verification added, stale root-worker duplicates
    quarantined and deleted; `cloudflare-bot/` is canonical.
  - Testable core extracted: `links.py`, `storage.py`, `note_builder.py`,
    `llm_client.py` + 34 unit tests and 11 end-to-end tests (45/45 green).
  - CacheDB hardened: `busy_timeout`, connect timeout, cross-thread locking,
    idempotent close.

### Verification dashboard (`dashboard/`)
- Next.js 16 live verification console for the Python app:
  - `/api/verify` — on-demand compile gate (9 files) + full test run with
    per-case timing and code fingerprints (sha256 per file).
  - `/api/history` — SQLite-persisted run history (Prisma), drift detection
    ("working tree changed since last verification"), timing insights,
    regression/flaky detection, CSV export.
  - 7-tab UI: Overview, Fixes, Audit, Tests, Go-Live checklist, History,
    Insights — dark/light/system themes, fully responsive, WCAG-checked.
- Portable layout: expects the Python app at `../app` (override with
  `GITCURATOR_APP_DIR`).

### Notes
- Runtime caches (`app/cache.db`, `app/error_outbox.db`,
  `dashboard/db/custom.db`) are gitignored; zip backups include them.
